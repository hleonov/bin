AB  - A structure-function analysis of the influenza A virus M2 ion channel
      protein was performed. The M2 protein of human influenza virus A/Udorn/72
      and mutants containing changes on one face of the putative alpha helix of
      the M2 transmembrane (TM) domain, several of which lead to amantadine
      resistance when found in virus, were expressed in oocytes of Xenopus
      laevis. The membrane currents of oocytes expressing mutant M2 ion channels
      were measured at both normal and low pH, and the amantadine-resistant
      mutant containing the change of alanine at residue 30 to threonine was
      found to have a significantly attenuated low pH activation response. The
      specific activity of the channel current of the amantadine-resistant
      mutants was investigated by measuring the membrane current of individual
      oocytes followed by quantification of the amount of M2 protein expressed
      in these single oocytes by immunoblotting analysis. The data indicate that
      changing residues on this face of the putative alpha helix of the M2 TM
      domain alters properties of the M2 ion channel. Some of the M2 proteins
      containing changes in the TM domain were found to be modified by addition
      of an N-linked carbohydrate chain at an asparagine residue that is
      membrane proximal and which is not modified in the wild-type M2 protein.
      These N-linked carbohydrate chains were further modified by addition of
      polylactosaminoglycan. A glycosylated M2 mutant protein (M2 + V, A30T)
      exhibited an ion channel activity with a voltage-activated, time-dependent
      kinetic component. Prevention of carbohydrate addition did not affect the
      altered channel activity. The ability of the M2 protein to tolerate
      deletions in the TM domain was examined by expressing three mutants
      (del29-31, del28-31, and del27-31) containing deletions of three, four,
      and five residues in the TM domain. No ion channel activity was detected
      from expression of M2 del29-31 and del27-31, whereas expression of M2
      del28-31 resulted in an ion channel activity that was activated by
      hyperpolarization (and not low pH) and was resistant to amantadine block.
      Examination of the oligomeric form of M2 del28-31 indicated that the
      oligomer is different from wild-type M2, and the data were consistent with
      M2 del28-31 forming a pentamer.
